<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<br />
<p><b>Taunton Model Engineers are working on designing and building a signalling system.</b>
These pages will contain every detail of the design and build as it progresses, 'Open Sourcing' ensures no one person achieves indispensibility, and that as time goes by, others will have the information needed to carry on, solving all the usual problems along the way.
