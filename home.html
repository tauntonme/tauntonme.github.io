<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<br />
<p><b>A group of Taunton Model Engineers are working on designing and building a signalling system.</b>
The intention is that these pages will contain every detail of the design and build as it progresses, 'Open Sourcing' in this manner to ensure that no one person achieves indispensibility, and that as time goes by, others will have the information needed to carry on, solving all the usual problems along the way.

<p>These pages will be transferred to our own "West Buck Signalling" web site once set up, enabling updates from any member in the Signalling Team.</p>
<br />
<p>All design files of ANY type, and absolutely everything to do with the signalling system will be found here.  </p>
<p>As at Feb 2023 this is a Work In Progress.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Subjects touched upon to date : -</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking the project into manageable chunks</li>
<li>Safe methods for detecting positions of mechanical items - gates, semaphores etc.</li>
<li>Power, cabling and ducts</li>
<li>Train detection</li>
<li>Control systems</li>
<li>What is needed for a signal to show "Clear"</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Areas in need of progress, soon or next</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Identify group to progress turnout actuators and systems</li>
    <li>Identify group to complete works on level crossing</li>
    <li>Fix positions and install posts, cabling etc for lineside signals</li>
    <li>Signlbox</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downloads - Please Note - </strong>You can download many types of files here - pdf documents, jpg images, spreadsheets and all sorts. Obviously not all files types are viewable on a web browser, .dxf and .dwg, for example, but web space is good for storing files of all and any type.</p>
