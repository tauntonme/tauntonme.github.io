<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<h4>To that end we have devised and agreed 'The Moving Parts Rule'</h4>
<br />

<p>There are a number of 'Moving Parts' on the railway of concern to the Signalling System.</p>
<p>The signalling system needs to 'know', with certainty, the physical positions of items including semaphore signals, track turnout parts, level crossing gates, traversers, and maybe other items.</p>
<h4>The MOVING PARTS RULE</h4>
<b><i><p>"Any assembly including any 'Moving Part' is to include an associated pair of position sensors, each with a single electrical logic switch output.  This pair of electrical signals (a 2 bit binary code) provides sufficient information for the signalling system to read the status of the moving part as being in any one of four possible states : -</p>
<ol>
<li>In safe position 'A'</li>
<li>In safe position 'B'</li>
<li>Not in safe Position 'A' and not in safe Position 'B'</li>
<li>Faulty or missing"</li>
</ol></i></b>
<p>This minimal interface will be sufficient to return unambiguous confirmation of position of single moving parts such as a gate, a semaphore signal etc.</p>
<p>Where mechanical locks or interlocks are used, these are in themselves separate 'moving parts' which will need to comply with the Moving Part Rule.</p>
<!--
<p><b>A group of Taunton Model Engineers are working on designing and building a signalling system.</b>
The intention is that these pages will contain every detail of the design and build as it progresses, 'Open Sourcing' in this manner to ensure that no one person achieves indispensibility, and that as time goes by and the reaper does his stuff, others will have the information needed to carry on, solving all the usual problems along the way.

<p>This page is just a dummy demo.  It is easy enough to upload files of ANY type.  The menu above is for example only, please do not expect selections to work!</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Other stuff coming soon - maybe : -</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking the project into manageable chunks</li>
<li>Safe methods for detecting positions of mechanical items - gates, semaphores etc</i>.</li>
<li>Power, cabling and ducts</li>
<li>Train detection</li>
<li>Other diversions that arise taking attention from any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downloads - Please Note - </strong>You can download many types of files here - pdf documents, jpg images, spreadsheets and all sorts. Obviously not all files types are viewable on a web browser, .dxf and .dwg, for example, but web space is good for storing files of all and any type.  Some web browsers occasionally throw a hissy fit about some of these file types, incorrectly reporting them as being full of spyware or virus. This is not so, try a different browser if problems seen.</p>
