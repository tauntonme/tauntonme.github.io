<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<br />
<h4>Electrical Power Distribution</h4>
<p>First thoughts on site-wide power distribution for signalling envisaged low voltage for safety, 50V D.C. was chosen as a compromise being high enough to travel some distance using low-cost cable. Local supplies at lower voltages would be obtained using one of any number of available switch-mode converters designed for the purpose.</p>
	<p>A suggestion has now been made to consider use of low voltage A.C. instead.  Using a balanced 110V centre tap earthed supply would still comply with 'site safety' concerns.  Adoption of A.C. would require a low cost local D.C. supply at every signal or other equipment site with a benefit of removing need for a low impedance negative return, however the cost would be offset by saving in cable costs.</p>
<p>An A.C. supply could be wired to socket outlets for use of power tools etc.</p>
