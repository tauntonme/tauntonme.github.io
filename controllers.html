<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<br />
<h4>Control System - a Brief Overview</h4>
<p>We are not building a Victorian railway.</p>
<p>We are designing and building simple, reliable signalling systems to promote safer running of the railway. 21st century engineering methods and materials are used to ensure objectives are met in a timely and cost effective manner.  For lineside railway signals 'coloured light' is the default but semaphore signals may also be used.</p>

<p>At West Buckland we are looking at signalling needs in simple control-system terms, identifying our railway signalling systems as "broad" and "shallow" - that is to say 'broad' encompassing some 'tens of items' to be monitored or controlled, and 'shallow' in the sense that all can be described in terms of simple Boolean expressions evaluating as 'true' or 'false', with no need for analogue processing, mathematics, or anything remotely difficult - No Hidden Depths!</p>
<p>Historic signalling systems may have used complex mechanical arrangements of rods and linkages to implement the logic and safety interlocking. Minor changes involved major rework. Unencumbered by historic baggage, our modern approach builds logic and safety using 'Near Plain English' text files. Rework is easy and cost free.</p>

<p>Use will be made of British designed 'ARM Cortex' controllers, the most widely used controller family worldwide.  Several manufacturers offer ARM Cortex variants, our chosen is <a href="https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/stm32-mcu-developer-zone.html" target="_blank">ST Microelectronics</a>, their <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html" target="_blank">"STM32CubeIDE"</a> enables very short design cycles, making best use of the architecture.  Wide support ensures these controllers will be workable, and re-workable, for many years to come.</p>
<p>Programming languages are "C" and "C++".  These are regulated by ISO - world standards, <b><i>NOT</i></b> corporate interests.  This ensures code will remain re-workable for the foreseeable future.  Improvements are regularly introduced into "C++" (a superset of "C"), better methods have evolved over decades, additions are introduced, but nothing gets taken out.  That's how we can be certain our code has a secure future.</p>
<br />
<!--<h4>"C++" Code can be made Easy for <i>"Normal People"</i> to read, understand, and modify !</h4>-->
<p>Using "C++" we can design the behaviours of our signalling system using statements recognisable as 'Plain English'.  Recourse to 'relay ladder logic' or other obsolete terminologies or methods are discouraged as unhelpful and unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>As designed, at first 'switch-on', all railway signals will show "Danger", and that's the way it'll stay until we have given the signalling system good reason to do otherwise. 'Plain English'-like Boolean expressions for each signal provide the justification for other display aspects.</p>
<br />
<p>For example, suppose there is a signal named 'Sig13'.  Conditions for this to show "Clear" might be that:-</p>
<ul>
    <li>TurnoutNo7 ahead set for 'Route A'</li>
    <li>Level crossing safe to cross</li>
    <li>No train in section ahead</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting this in even plainer English, "Sig13 Clear when :</p>
<p>(TurnoutNo7 ahead set for 'Route A' AND Level crossing safe to cross AND No train in section ahead)"</p>
<p>This is very close to the Boolean expression to enter in the code for Sig13. For the expression to evaluate 'true' and so to show a 'Clear' aspect, condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 must all evaluate 'true'. Any one or more being 'false' will keep the signal set to 'Danger'.</p>
<p>Of course, for the signalling system to work, it will need to be able to read the position of TurnoutNo7, will need to be able to read and verify all four level crossing gates and any gate locks are in the 'safe' position, and to have kept note of train movements to be certain section ahead is clear.</p>
<p>But then, a decision is reached that this is wrong as the Sig13 signal should indicate 'Clear' for either route 'A' or route 'B', and the code is changed to remove the constraint of TurnoutNo7 simplifying the expression to :</p>
<p>(Level crossing safe to cross AND No train in section ahead)</p>
<p>After a number of derailments on TurnoutNo7, it is realised the expression for Sig13 should check that TurnoutNo7 is set safely for one route or the other as for a number of reasons the turnout blades could be positioned to cause derailments.  This problem is solved by modifying the expression once again to :</p>
<p>((TurnoutNo7 ahead set for 'Route A' OR TurnoutNo7 ahead set for 'Route B') AND Level crossing safe to cross AND No train in section ahead)</p>
<p>In general, the position of all moving parts of the railway - semaphore signals, gates, turnouts, locks, levers - must be readable by the signalling system, because it can not act upon information it has not got!.</p>

<!--
<p>Bear with me. I can justify such a bold and potentially controversial statement in the context of relatively simple control systems - such as our signalling systems.</p>
<p>The controller runs the "programme" - the code we have written for it using "C" and "C++", a list of instructions. The programme splits cleanly into two sections :</p>
<ul><li>Startup Code</li><li>Forever Loop</li></ul>
<p>The Startup code sets up controller conditions, initialises internal timers, counters, converters and all the hardware.  This, if you like, configures and connects the controller to the world it is to control.  Startup code runs once-only at power-up. It can be cryptic, but fortunately our software development tools create most of it for us.  Once we're happy with the startup code, with luck we'll never have to look at it again.</p>
<p>The Forever loop repeats forever (until the power goes off). In the loop, all inputs are looked at and used to make any changes to outputs in response.  The loop repeats many times per second, making control look 'real time'.  It is the Forever Loop that contains all of our 'what ifs' and details of the semaphores, turnouts, gates, or whatever we are controlling.  All of this can be coded easily enough using "C", so why "C++"?</p>
<p>"C++" is for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">'Object Oriented Programming'</a>. What this means for us</p>
<p>OOP encourages us to create software models of real world 'objects'.  By designing 'objects' with a clean interface (the means of interaction with the object), much of the tiresome internal detail can be hidden from view leaving us to code for object interactions being certain (?) of what they do, without having to be burdened by remembering how they do it!</p>
<p>This means that more code can migrate into Startup Code, leaving the Forever Loop as much smaller and so easier to read and maintain. (Maybe not the best explanation in the world, but it'll have to do!).  At best, the Forever Loop reduces to little more than a sequence of 'near plain English' Boolean expressions.</p>
<br />
<p>Howls of protest will arise. "<i>In my day we used damp string, witchcraft and relays. Don't need computers</i>" but fear not. None of the TME Dinosaur Tendency will have read this far !</p>
<p>With our system, all we need is a plain English description of requirements for the signal to show "Clear". We take your plain English and reduce it to a 'Boolean Expression' which will still be recognisable as English language, and use this to instruct the system to examine all the input conditions you include and evaluate the expression as 'True' or 'False'.  If then the signal does not behave as you expect, go back and look at what you've asked for and work out for yourself what you missed out. Couldn't be simpler!</p>
<p>And, of course, there's no need to work out what's needed to make a signal show 'Danger'. It will show 'Danger' whenever your rule for 'Clear' evaluates 'False'.</p>
<br />
<p>ST Microelectronics supply low-cost, very easy to use controller boards. Our system will use a number of these of more than one type. The <a href="https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Nucleo-L432KC/" target="_blank">NUCLEO-L432KC (link opens in new tab)</a> at under Â£10 is likely to feature in several places.  On a pcb with a few other cheap components, one of these could, for example, deal with everything to do with the level crossing, accepting commands and reporting status via a network connection.  Another use might be to provide any practical number of 'Standard Interfaces' built using daisy-chained shift registers accessed through an SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).</p>
<p>Another member of the ST family, <a href="https://os.mbed.com/platforms/ST-Discovery-F746NG/" target="_blank">Discovery-F746NG (link opens in new tab)</a> is a contender for the role of 'central' controller.  This has a display (of limited use perhaps) but includes a large non-volatile memory, useful for data logging.</p>
<p>Not sourced to date - anything for creating a large display panel in the signalbox.  This might be a good project for a junior member with Raspberry Pi experience ?</p>

<h4>Controller - Detail Overview</h4>
<p>Controllers for 'wide, shallow' systems such as WB signalling can be very simple and low cost.</p>

<p>The above shows the essential elements of the control system. The ultimate control element is the low cost STM32L432KC module.  Expansion to provide the high number of input/output lines required is achieved by daisy-chaining 74HC595 and 74HC597 shift registers - four stages shown above providing 32 each inputs and outputs. Any practical number of stages may be added.</p>
<p>Other niceties - IC3 is a CAN bus interface for linking a number of controllers (if required). IC1 is a memory for storing local setup or other info.  </p>
<p>The 'logic level' electrical signals internal to the controller are low voltage, low power. Interfacing to the 'Big Bad World' sensibly requires that the connections seen on the outside of the controller box be, as far as possible, infinitely abusable.  That's the task of the IO Interfaces.</p>
<br />

<p>Above, left input interface, right output interface.</p>
<p>Input - Inputs are standard 'current sink' design. Positive input currents rising &gt; 4mA will be read by the controller as '1'. Hysteresis provided by the 74HC14 Schmitt trigger ensures noise immunity, positive input currents falling &lt; 2mA will be read as '0'.  Protection against abuse of inputs : D3 provides protection against application of negative input voltages to -70V. This will be sufficient in this system with no negative supplies. D2 is a 'constant current diode' <a href="https://www.mouser.co.uk/datasheet/2/849/cl05m6f-2577303.pdf" target="_blank">(see data)</a> which passes nominal 5.6mA for voltages in range of 3 - 190 volt so providing protection for positive voltages much higher than found in the system. R6, R7, R8 allow for accommodation of future 'ah but' requests. C10 rolls off any high frequency response.</p>
<p>Output - Outputs are standard 'current source' design. Q3, R9, R10 form a switched current sink controlled by a controller output shift register bit. A logic '1' turns on the sink which biases Q4 into a state where it would be capable of sourcing &gt; 100mA. D4 is another constant current diode, limiting output source current to 15mA.  D5 protects against damage from high positive voltages applied to output connections.</p>
<p>The overall system may need more inputs than outputs.  Allowing for equal numbers results in the likely availability of 'spare' outputs which could be used to power inputs, avoiding the need for separate input power sources - good design practice.</p>
<p>Output current sourcing capability is a little more than twice input current. This ensure one or two inputs powered per output, will be read correctly. Using 'spare' outputs to power inputs makes possible implementation of certain logic funcions through the ability to power or de-power individual inputs. Using 'wired logic' in this manner is however discouraged, as any intention is unlikely to be discernable reading the hand-coded boolean expressions intended to define system behaviour. </p>
