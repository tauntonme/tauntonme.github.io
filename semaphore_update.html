<h2><b>Signals for West Buckland Miniature Railway</b></h2>
<h4>The purpose of the signalling system is to promote safer running of the railway.</h4>
<br />

<p>Way back in time now, years ago, there was much Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth from certain quarters at the thought of a signalling system without semaphores.  
	Others tried to offer reassurance, and suggested that those keen on these things would be more than welcome to make them.</p>
	
<p>And so it was that one, or maybe two, members agreed to design and make a number of semaphore signals.</p>
<p>As I've said, that was all years ago.  What have we seen ?</p>
	<p>Er ...</p>


<!--
<p><b>A group of Taunton Model Engineers are working on designing and building a signalling system.</b>
The intention is that these pages will contain every detail of the design and build as it progresses, 'Open Sourcing' in this manner to ensure that no one person achieves indispensibility, and that as time goes by and the reaper does his stuff, others will have the information needed to carry on, solving all the usual problems along the way.

<p>This page is just a dummy demo.  It is easy enough to upload files of ANY type.  The menu above is for example only, please do not expect selections to work!</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>Other stuff coming soon - maybe : -</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking the project into manageable chunks</li>
<li>Safe methods for detecting positions of mechanical items - gates, semaphores etc</i>.</li>
<li>Power, cabling and ducts</li>
<li>Train detection</li>
<li>Other diversions that arise taking attention from any of the above.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downloads - Please Note - </strong>You can download many types of files here - pdf documents, jpg images, spreadsheets and all sorts. Obviously not all files types are viewable on a web browser, .dxf and .dwg, for example, but web space is good for storing files of all and any type.  Some web browsers occasionally throw a hissy fit about some of these file types, incorrectly reporting them as being full of spyware or virus. This is not so, try a different browser if problems seen.</p>
